# AWS Serverless and Serverless Framework

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Pl9gBJp6RZyzhG3XGo-NBQ.jpeg)

Serverless is a cloud computing execution model that

*   Automatically provisions the computing resources required to run application code on demand, or in response to a specific event;
*   Automatically scales those resources up or down in response to increased or decreased demand;
*   Automatically scales resources to zero when the application stops running.

Serverless offloads all management responsibility for backend cloud infrastructure and operations tasks — provisioning, scheduling, scaling, patching, and more — to the cloud provider. This gives developers more time to develop and optimize their front-end application code and business logic. And with serverless, customers never pay for idle capacity. They pay only for the resources required to run their applications, and only when those applications are running.

I have published two different playlists to talk about different things we can do with AWS serverless and serverless framework

Before we get into the playlist we need to understand three different aspects

*   what is serverless computing
*   How AWS provided serverless computing using lambda functions
*   How we can use Serverless framework to build a serverless app using different Cloud Providers

## AWS Serverless

AWS Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. Using lambda function enables serverless execution and with Lambda we can use other AWS services to execute that lambda function in a serverless environment.

## AWS Lambda

[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume

## Amazon API Gateway

[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale

## Amazon DynamoDB

[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.

## Serverless framework

The Serverless Framework is a free and open-source web framework written using Node.js. Serverless is the first framework developed for building applications on AWS Lambda, a serverless computing platform provided by Amazon as a part of Amazon Web Services.

Both of my playlists cover all different aspects of servers computing and how can use serverless technology with AWS and then how can we automate it using a serverless framework.
